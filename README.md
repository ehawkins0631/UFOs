UFOs Finder Site

The improved search criteria works as follows:

Select first search criteria by selecting the filter search box of choice and inputting criteria

To add more search criteria, simply continue to add more filters in other filter search boxes

The user can add up to 5 filters, including date, city, state, country, and shape.

UFO Finder Summary
One drawback of this new design is that the filter search fields are ridgid. If the dates, cities, states, country, or shapes are not input exactly as they appear in the database, the filter will not return them. This is ok for states and dates, but limits the functionality of filtering by shape drastically.

Two recommendations for further development are as follows.
Improve flexibility of the filter inputs.
Improve database to include more up to date sightings.
